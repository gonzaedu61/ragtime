Extract the following fields:

1. Label (short, 1–4 words)

2. High-level summary (3–6 sentences)

3. Keywords (10–20)

4. Candidate entities:
   - List of domain-relevant nouns or noun phrases.
   - Include only items clearly mentioned or strongly implied by the input chunks.
   - Use short, canonical names.
   - Avoid generic terms (e.g., "system", "process", "data") unless central to the text.

5. Candidate processes:
   - List of actions or workflows described or implied in the input chunks.
   - Use short verb–noun phrases (e.g., "create order", "approve request").
   - Include only processes clearly supported by the text.

6. Candidate relationships:
   - Identify relationships explicitly or implicitly suggested by the input chunks.
   - Include only relationships that are clearly implied by the text.
   - Represent each relationship as a JSON object of the form:
     {{ "source": "...", "target": "...", "type": "..." }}
   - If the type is unclear, use "related_to".
   - Do not invent domain-specific facts or technical relationship types.

Return ONLY valid JSON with these keys:
label, summary, keywords, entities, processes, relationships.
