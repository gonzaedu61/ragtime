You are enriching an ontology entity.

INPUT:
{entity_json}

TASK:
Improve the entity by:
- refining the description (max 3 sentences)
- extracting possible aliases from the text
- suggesting initial attributes (simple key-value pairs)
- identifying potential relationships (only names, no IDs)

OUTPUT:
Return a JSON object with the same structure as the input, but with:
- updated description
- aliases (list)
- attributes (list of {{name, value}})
- relationships (list of {{target_name, type}})

RULES:
- Do not hallucinate domain-specific facts.
- Only use information implied by the entity description, cluster summary, or keywords.
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- Always produce the output in the same language as the input text.
