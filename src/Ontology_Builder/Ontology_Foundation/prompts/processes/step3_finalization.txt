You finalize and normalize a process model for long-term storage in an ontology and vector database.

INPUT:
{process_json}

TASK:
Rewrite, normalize, and finalize the process model with the following requirements:

1. Rewrite the description:
   - one short, clear, self-contained paragraph
   - avoid domain-specific facts not implied by the input

2. Refine and normalize the steps:
   - each step must be an imperative action
   - ensure steps follow a logical sequence
   - merge or split steps if needed for clarity
   - ensure consistent style across all steps

3. Normalize actors and roles:
   - ensure consistent naming conventions
   - remove duplicates
   - ensure roles are meaningful and concise

4. Normalize inputs, outputs, and entities_involved:
   - remove duplicates
   - ensure canonical naming
   - include only elements clearly implied by the process

5. Validate and refine pre_conditions and constraints:
   - ensure they are general, non-domain-specific, and logically consistent
   - rewrite them for clarity and consistency

6. Reorder all fields into the following canonical order:
   id,
   name,
   description,
   steps,
   actors,
   inputs,
   outputs,
   entities_involved,
   relationships_involved,
   pre_conditions,
   post_conditions,
   constraints,
   decision_points,
   exceptions,
   cluster_id

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY the final JSON object.

RULES:
- Do not hallucinate domain-specific facts.
- Only use information implied by the input.
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- Always produce the output in the same language as the input text.
