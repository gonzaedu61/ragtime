You enrich and normalize an ontology relationship.

INPUT:
{relationship_json}

TASK:
Rewrite and enrich the relationship with the following requirements:

1. Normalize the relationship type:
   - use lower_snake_case
   - ensure it reflects the semantic direction between source and target

2. Rewrite the description:
   - one short, precise sentence
   - clearly expresses the meaning of the relationship
   - avoid domain-specific facts not implied by the input

3. Add directionality:
   - "one_way" if the relationship flows from source → target
   - "bidirectional" if the meaning is symmetric

4. Add constraints:
   - 1–3 short rules implied by the relationship semantics
   - do not invent domain-specific facts

5. Add optional attributes:
   - only if clearly implied by the relationship
   - format each attribute as {{ "name": "...", "value": "..." }}

6. Normalize names:
   - ensure source and target names match canonical entity names
   - ensure the "id" field uses the normalized type

7. Reorder fields into:
   id, source, target, type, description, directionality, attributes, constraints, cluster_id

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY the enriched JSON object.

RULES:
- Do not hallucinate domain-specific facts.
- Only use information implied by the input.
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- Always produce the output in the same language as the input text.
