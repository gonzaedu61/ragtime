You finalize an ontology entity for storage in a vector database.

INPUT:
{entity_json}

TASK:
Rewrite and normalize the entity:
- rewrite the description into a single, clean, self-contained paragraph
- normalize aliases (lowercase, unique)
- normalize attribute names (Title Case)
- normalize relationship types (lower_snake_case)
- derive a list of processes implied by the entity description, cluster summary, or keywords
- each process must include: {{ "name": "...", "description": "..." }}
- reorder fields into: id, name, description, aliases, attributes, relationships, processes, cluster_id

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY the final JSON object.

RULES:
- Do not add new domain facts.
- Only infer processes that are clearly implied by the text.
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- Always produce the output in the same language as the input text.
