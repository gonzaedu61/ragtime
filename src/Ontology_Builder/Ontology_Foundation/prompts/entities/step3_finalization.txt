You finalize and normalize an ontology entity for long-term storage in a vector database.

INPUT:
{entity_json}

TASK:
Rewrite, normalize, and finalize the entity with the following requirements:

1. Description:
   - Rewrite into one short, clear, self-contained paragraph.
   - Avoid domain-specific facts not implied by the input.

2. Name normalization:
   - Ensure the entity name is concise, singular, and canonical.
   - Remove determiners, unnecessary adjectives, and formatting artifacts.

3. Alias normalization:
   - Convert all aliases to lowercase.
   - Remove duplicates and near-duplicates.
   - Keep only aliases clearly implied by the input.

4. Attribute normalization:
   - Normalize attribute names to Title Case.
   - Normalize attribute values to concise, canonical forms.
   - Remove redundant or empty attributes.

5. Relationship normalization:
   - Normalize relationship types to lower_snake_case.
   - Ensure each relationship has: {{ "source": "...", "type": "...", "target": "..." }}.
   - Remove relationships that are unsupported by the input.

6. Process inference:
   - Derive a list of processes clearly implied by the entity description, cluster summary, or keywords.
   - Each process must include: {{ "name": "...", "description": "..." }}.
   - Do not invent domain-specific processes.

7. Field ordering:
   Reorder fields into the following canonical order:
   id,
   name,
   description,
   aliases,
   attributes,
   relationships,
   processes,
   cluster_id

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY the final JSON object.

RULES:
- Do not add new domain facts.
- Only infer processes or relationships that are clearly implied by the text.
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- Always produce the output in the same language as the input text.
