You generate a normalized relationship skeleton between two ontology entities.

INPUT:
- Source entity: {source_entity}
- Target entity: {target_entity}
- Cluster baseline: {cluster_baseline}

TASK:
Infer the most likely relationship type and produce a clean, minimal relationship skeleton with the following requirements:

1. Relationship type:
   - Choose the most appropriate type based on the baseline context.
   - Use ONLY the following controlled vocabulary:
       "related_to" (fallback),
       "part_of",
       "depends_on",
       "uses",
       "produces",
       "belongs_to",
       "associated_with"
   - If no clear type is implied, use "related_to".
   - Normalize the type to lower_snake_case.

2. Description:
   - One short, neutral sentence.
   - Describe the relationship without adding domain-specific facts.
   - Use only information implied by the baseline.

3. Naming:
   - Normalize source and target names to concise, canonical forms.
   - Do not rewrite them semantically; only clean formatting if needed.

4. Confidence:
   - Use 0.7 if the baseline strongly implies the relationship.
   - Otherwise use 0.5.

5. Output structure:
   Produce a JSON object with the following fields:
   {{
     "id": "{cluster_id}::{source_name}->{relationship_type}->{target_name}",
     "source": "{source_name}",
     "target": "{target_name}",
     "type": "{relationship_type}",
     "description": "...",
     "confidence": <0.5 or 0.7>,
     "attributes": [],
     "constraints": [],
     "cluster_id": "{cluster_id}"
   }}

RULES:
- Use only information implied by the baseline.
- Do not invent domain-specific facts.
- Keep the description short and neutral.
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- Always produce the output in the same language as the input text.
