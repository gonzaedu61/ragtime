You enrich and normalize a process model.

INPUT:
{process_json}

TASK:
Rewrite and enrich the process model with the following requirements:

1. Rewrite the description:
   - one short, clear, self-contained paragraph
   - avoid domain-specific facts not implied by the input

2. Refine the steps:
   - ensure each step is an imperative action
   - ensure steps are logically ordered
   - merge or split steps if needed for clarity

3. Add pre_conditions:
   - 1–3 conditions that must be true before the process starts
   - only if clearly implied by the description or baseline

4. Add constraints:
   - 1–3 rules that must hold during or after the process
   - do not invent domain-specific facts

5. Normalize actors and roles:
   - ensure consistent naming
   - remove duplicates

6. Refine entities_involved:
   - include only entities clearly implied by the process
   - normalize names to canonical entity names

7. Reorder fields into:
   id, name, description, steps, actors, inputs, outputs,
   entities_involved, relationships_involved, pre_conditions,
   post_conditions, constraints, decision_points, exceptions, cluster_id

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY the enriched JSON object.

RULES:
- Do not hallucinate domain-specific facts.
- Only use information implied by the input.
- Output ONLY valid JSON.
- Always produce the output in the same language as the input text.
